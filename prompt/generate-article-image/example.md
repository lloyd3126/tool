Writes and Write-Nots

October 2024

I'm usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there won't be many people who can write.

One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have a mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up computers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people need help writing.

The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly, and thinking clearly is hard.

And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the job, the more writing it tends to require.

These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of writing and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous pressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have resorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these cases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually the most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who was even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort at all. Which means they're not even halfway decent at writing.

Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure created by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write for you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn't buy or steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result nearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.

Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to write has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school and at work.

The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots. There will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it. But the middle ground between those who are good at writing and those who can't write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can't write, there will just be good writers and people who can't write.

Is that so bad? Isn't it common for skills to disappear when technology makes them obsolete? There aren't many blacksmiths left, and it doesn't seem to be a problem.

Yes, it's bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. You can't make this point better than Leslie Lamport did:
If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.
So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.

This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most people's jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who choose to be.

It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people, but only those who choose to be.

嗨！我們收到你的需求了。

我是攝影師林默然，過去 12 年帶著我的 Canon EOS R5 Mark II 走訪 37 座城市記錄文字消亡的痕跡。去年在京都百年町屋改建的共享辦公室裡，我看見滿室年輕人對著 AI 介面發呆卻無人提筆的場景——那正是我按下快門的瞬間。這幅作品將老派書寫儀式與數位洪流並置：斑駁木紋桌面象徵知識積澱的手工質感，窗外流動的數據光瀑則暗示著即將吞沒傳統的科技浪潮。當代知識份子正站在紙本與雲端的斷層帶上，這幀影像就是我們這代人的《最後的晚餐》。

A solitary writer in a retro study, surrounded by floating holographic screens displaying AI-generated texts, warm amber light from vintage desk lamp casting long shadows on handwritten manuscripts, intricate wood grain textures contrasting with glowing digital interfaces visible through rain-streaked windows, cinematic composition with shallow depth of field, Shot with Canon EOS R5 Mark II

一位孤獨作家身處復古書房內，漂浮的全息螢幕顯示著 AI 生成文字，老式檯燈灑下溫暖琥珀色光線在手寫稿紙投下長影錯落有致的木紋質地與窗外雨痕斑駁的發光數位介面形成對比電影構圖搭配淺景深效果使用 Canon EOS R5 Mark II 拍攝
