Writes and Write-Nots

October 2024

I'm usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there won't be many people who can write.

One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have a mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up computers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people need help writing.

The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly, and thinking clearly is hard.

And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the job, the more writing it tends to require.

These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of writing and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous pressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have resorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these cases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually the most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who was even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort at all. Which means they're not even halfway decent at writing.

Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure created by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write for you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn't buy or steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result nearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.

Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to write has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school and at work.

The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots. There will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it. But the middle ground between those who are good at writing and those who can't write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can't write, there will just be good writers and people who can't write.

Is that so bad? Isn't it common for skills to disappear when technology makes them obsolete? There aren't many blacksmiths left, and it doesn't seem to be a problem.

Yes, it's bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. You can't make this point better than Leslie Lamport did:
If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.
So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.

This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most people's jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who choose to be.

It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people, but only those who choose to be.

能寫者與不能寫者

2024年10月

我通常不願對科技發展做出預測，但這次卻相當篤定：二十年後，真正會寫作的人將所剩無幾。

從事寫作後最令人詫異的發現之一，就是竟有如此多人苦於文字表達。醫生知曉多少人為痣斑煩惱；電腦高手明白多少人搞不定系統設定；而作家最清楚有多少人需要寫作協助。

許多人寫作困難的根本原因在於寫作本身極具挑戰性。優秀的文字產出需要清晰的思維——而清晰思考本就是艱難之事。

然而文字工作卻滲透諸多行業，職位越顯赫者往往越需倚重文字能力。

這兩股強大對立力量——無所不在的書寫要求與本質性的操作難度——形成巨大壓力場。這正是為何知名教授屢屢爆出剽竊醜聞。最令我震驚的是這些抄襲內容之瑣碎平庸：被竊取的通常是毫無新意的制式文字——任何稍具寫作能力者都能信手拈來的事務性文本。這意味著他們連最基本的文字駕馭能力都不具備。

直至近期，這種對立壓力始終缺乏有效紓解管道。你可以如甘迺迪般僱人代筆，或效仿馬丁路德金直接剽竊；若既無財力購買文字也無膽量竊取，就只能親自動筆。因此過去每個需要文字產出的人都被迫學習寫作。

但時代已然不同。人工智慧徹底顛覆了這個領域。無論校園或職場，文字壓力幾乎煙消雲散——你大可用AI代勞。

未來世界將分裂為「能寫者」與「不能寫者」。仍會有堅持手書之人——畢竟有人真心熱愛此道。但介於善書者與完全不能書寫者之間的灰色地帶將不復存在。屆時不再有優秀、普通與拙劣之分，唯餘善書者與文盲之別。

這很糟糕嗎？當科技淘汰舊技能時消失不是常態？正如鐵匠行業式微也無人憂心。

問題在於我先前提及的關鍵：書寫即思考。更精確地說，存在一種唯有透過書寫方能進行的思維模式。Leslie Lamport對此有精闢見解：
若未經書寫便自認完成思考，那只不過是思考的幻覺。
因此「能寫者」與「不能寫者」的分野實則暗藏更危險的真相——那將是「能思者」與「不思者」的鴻溝。我清楚自己要站在哪一邊，相信你也是。

此景並非史無前例。工業革命前多數職業自然鍛鍊體魄；當今若想強健體魄則需刻意健身。因此仍有強健之人存在——但僅限主動選擇者。

未來文字能力亦復如是。屆時仍有睿智之士——但僅存於主動選擇精進之人。
